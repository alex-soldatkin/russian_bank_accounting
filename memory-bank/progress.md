# Progress: Russian Bank Accounting EDA

## What works
- Initial project setup and directory structure are in place.
- Core Memory Bank documentation (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) has been created, providing a foundational understanding of the project.
- The `explore_schema.py` script has been created and executed, providing initial insights into the dataset's structure, data types, missing values, and key indicators.
- Sophisticated visualization proposals have been outlined.
- The `preprocess_data.py` script has been created and executed, handling missing values and providing an example of normalization.
- Initial visualizations have been implemented and executed, specifically:
    - Interactive line charts for total assets (`total_assets_time_series.html`, `log_total_assets_time_series.html`).
    - Interactive histograms and density plots for Return on Assets (ROA) (`roa_histogram.html`, `roa_density_plot.html`).
- The `ggsave` syntax for `lets-plot` has been corrected in both visualization scripts and documented in `memory-bank/techContext.md`.

## What's left to build
- **Remaining Visualization Scripts:** Continue creating individual Python scripts in `./visualisations` for the other proposed interactive dashboards using `lets-plot`.
- **Outlier Detection:** Implement methods to identify and visualize outliers in the data.
- **Static Visualizations:** Generate PNG and SVG versions of all visualizations (currently only HTML is generated).
- **Refine Preprocessing:** Further refine data preprocessing and normalization strategies as needed for specific visualizations.

## Current status
The project has completed the initial schema exploration, visualization planning, data preprocessing, and the implementation of the first set of visualizations, with corrected saving syntax. The next phase involves implementing the remaining proposed visualizations.

## Known issues
- No known issues at this stage.

## Evolution of project decisions
- The decision to use `uv` for environment management was made to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
- The emphasis on `lets-plot` stems from the requirement for interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
- The modular approach for EDA and visualization scripts is intended to improve maintainability and collaboration.
- The detailed visualization proposals will guide the implementation phase.
