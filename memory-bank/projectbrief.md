# Project Brief: Russian Bank Accounting EDA

## Core Requirements
- Conduct end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of bank accounting time series data.
- Data source: `data/HOORRAAH_final_banking_indicators_imputed_new.parquet`.
- Prioritize interactive dashboards using `lets-plot` (a Python port of ggplot).
- Each visualization should be a separate Python script in `./visualisations`.
- Data normalization is required (e.g., log transform, symlog, minmax scaler from scikit-learn).
- Focus on the distribution of variables and outlier detection.
- Initial step: Explore the schema of the bank accounting time series data using Python scripts saved to `./EDA_scripts`.
- Develop sophisticated and visually pleasing visualizations.

## Goals
- Understand the underlying structure and characteristics of the banking indicator data.
- Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within the time series.
- Create a comprehensive suite of interactive and static visualizations.
- Provide insights into the distribution of variables and detect outliers.
- Lay the groundwork for further analysis and model development.
