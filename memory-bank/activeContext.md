# Active Context: Russian Bank Accounting EDA

## Current work focus
The primary task has been the development and refinement of the Sankey dashboard, focusing on migrating data processing to DuckDB and implementing user-requested visualization enhancements. This includes improving visual distinction through transformations, adding REGN sampling to tooltips, and fixing various bugs.

## Recent changes (new)
- **DuckDB Refactor**: Completed the migration of data processing from pandas to DuckDB, ensuring efficient SQL-based operations.
- **Sankey Visualization Enhancements**:
    - **Link Colors and Alpha**: Adjusted link colors and alpha values for better visual distinction between active (green) and exit (red) flows.
    - **Tooltip Improvements**: Added the count of unique banks and a sample of REGNs to connection tooltips, with the sample size configurable via a UI input.
    - **Exit Bucket Node Position**: Ensured the 'Exit' bucket node is consistently positioned at the bottom of all other nodes.
    - **Year Markers**: Fixed the issue of missing year markers on the Sankey diagram.
    - **Power Transformation**: Introduced a new 'power' transform mode with a configurable exponent for better visual distinction of flow thicknesses.
- **Bug Fixes**:
    - Resolved `TypeError` related to passing `power_exponent` to `compute_sankey_for_variables`.
    - Corrected SQL query for `regn_sample` aggregation to resolve `Parser Error` by using a `SampledRegns` CTE and `array_slice`.
    - Addressed Pylance errors related to module attribute assignments and type hints.

## Current status
- [x] Sankey dashboard data processing fully refactored to DuckDB.
- [x] All requested UI controls and visualization enhancements implemented:
    - Size and thickness variable dropdowns.
    - Quantile slider.
    - STEP_YEARS slider.
    - MAX_YEAR_OVERRIDE input.
    - Transform mode dropdown with 'power' option.
    - Power Exponent slider for 'power' transform.
    - Unit scale dropdown.
    - Node thickness and pad sliders.
    - REGN sample size input.
- [x] Link colors and alpha values adjusted.
- [x] Tooltips now display unique bank counts and sample REGNs.
- [x] Exit bucket node correctly positioned at the bottom.
- [x] Year markers are displayed correctly.
- [x] Resolved `TypeError` for `power_exponent` parameter.
- [x] Resolved SQL `Parser Error` for `regn_sample` aggregation.

## Observations / Known issues
- Pylance errors related to `ModuleType` attribute assignments are noted but do not affect runtime functionality.

## Next steps (recommended)
1. **User Verification**: Confirm with the user that all implemented features (transformations, tooltips, ordering, REGN sampling, etc.) are working as expected.
2. **Further Refinements**: Based on user feedback, fine-tune the 'power' transform exponent or other visual aspects for optimal clarity.
3. **Add Unit Tests**: Consider adding automated unit/integration tests for `compute_sankey_for_variables` and related data processing functions.
4. **Code Cleanup**: Address any remaining linting or type warnings.
